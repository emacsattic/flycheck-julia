Add Julia support to [Flycheck][]:

- Add a `julia` syntax checker using [Lint.jl][]

Installation
------------

Install `flycheck-julia` from [MELPA][] or [MELPA Stable][]
and add the following to your `init.el`:

```elisp
(flycheck-julia-setup)
```

Usage
-----

Simply start linting by enabling `flycheck-mode`. If you use

the following to your `init.del`:

(add-to-list 'flycheck-global-modes 'ess-julia-mode)
```
